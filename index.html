      <h1>Welcome to Peri's Porfolio</h1>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring Graphic Designer, currently navigating through my
        university degree. As can be seen from my picture, I am definitely not
        dealing with a debilitating gambling addiction. In fact I despise
        gambling. Any mention in the word, and I begin shaking. With fury.
        Definitely not excitement. Anyways. Hire me please, I have lost all of
        my money through completely unrelated channels.
      </p>
